## Competition
#Project Title: 
Comparing Deep Learning with Neurologists for Functional Outcome Prediction in Stroke: An Observational Follow-up Study.

Project Description: A CT A CT DL model will compete against experienced neurologists in treatment effect and functional outcome prediction.
The competition will provide retrospectively collected clinical and imaging data from 40 selected patients from the MR cohort.

Procedure as follows:

1. Step: Descriptive Statistics (Table one for the MR cohort)
2. Step: Matching (Selection of 40 patients matched for BL variables)
3. Step: Anonymisation (Assignment of anonymous ID to each patient from the selection)
4. Step: Structure (Structuring and organising the folders)
5. Step: Competition sheet (A without CTP / B with CTP)
