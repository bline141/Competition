## Competition

Comparison of Deep Learning with Neurologists for Functional Outcome Prediction in Stroke: A Follow-up Study.

Project Description: 
The CT deep learning model was trained on data from the MR Cohort to predict the treatment effect (NIHSS after 24h) and the functional outcome (mRS after 3 months) in patients. For further validation the CT deep learning treatment effect and outcome predictions where then compared to those of experienced neurologists on a subset of 40 patients matched for baseline variables.

Procedure for competition as follows:

1. Step: Data cleaning and transformation (Exclusion of patients, definition of variables)
2. Step: Descriptive Statistics (Table one for the MR cohort)
3. Step: Selection and Matching (Selection of 40 patients matched for BL variables)
4. Step: Anonymisation (Assignment of anonymous ID to each patient from the selection)
5. Step: Structure (Structuring and organising the folders)
6. Step: Competition sheet (Clinical data / Imaging Data)
